@twarko Marko, you can be anything you want to be.
@M_PaulMcNamara @JohnArnoldFndtn Perfect for speculators.
@jen20 Been wondering the same myself. AWS has some starter kits. Also suggests 1.1 is the place to start. 
@twarko: I had a great time at @GraphDay. Same faces in new places... Take care everyone. #graphdb
@juansequeda: And that's a wrap. Great @GraphDay in SF! #gdsf17

@spmallette @pluradj Sweet!
@GrahamGanssle @agilegeo Oh hell yes.
@trwilmes: Exciting news, hosted @janusgraph is a reality 
@composeio: We're excited to announce a new #database to the Compose platform; welcome #JanusGraph, our first #Graph database. 
@sean_a_rose @Loh And he should know -- the books he translated are stellar.
@trwilmes: @janusgraph + @apachetinkerpop + @dropwizardio = your new #graphdb microservice 
@net_snow @postgresql Yeah, fair point.
Also, .@SQLServer with temporal tables is pretty slick.
Periodic reminder that even though there's a lot of fancy databases out there, sometimes postgresql just gets the job done. Keep it simple.

@tesh11 a boot camp as part of a "I love to learn" story works; as "now I'm a full stack programmer" less so. Hence why helpful as screening
@tesh11 I love the "broken" resume of someone who wanders and learns around passions, since that's what we do.

@chadQmartin @jkolko false dichotomy. No one thinks they can get hired as an engineer after 1 internship. Takes time.
@chadQmartin @jkolko selling a false promise, IMO. Love boot camps as a step on the road. Too many people think they are ready when done.
@chadQmartin @jkolko it takes a long time to become a plumber, accountant, engineer. Who thinks they can be a great programmer in 6 weeks?
@chadQmartin @jkolko but 6 weeks not enough. I think the boot camps are (hopefully unintentionally) predatory.
@chadQmartin @jkolko basic approach -- learn the starter skills and then do more -- is sound.

@neildanson @unclebobmartin types are shorthand, more so in a rich type system. Why write test for x&gt;0 if can use positive integer type?
@unclebobmartin @experoinc @HaskellCEO odd to see them in apparent conflict in your writing. But there are many paths to working code.

@FransBouma also it would appear I've threaded my response backwards. Sigh.
@FransBouma it's a technique worth discussing like others. Great for many. Bad for many. Typical consultant's answer right? 🤓
@FransBouma I get frustrated when people say "oh everyone should do FP it's so much better" AND when they say "too hard, experts only"
@FransBouma but not all programmers are natural UI hackers, or embedded systems coders, so why do they all have tone FP wizards?
@FransBouma I've found over the years that FP is easy and powerful for a sizable minority of good programmers. Others flounder.

@jen20 @randompunter there you have no argument from me at all.
@jen20 @randompunter e.g. you can write a new programming language in a month or two, but meaningless without debuggers, libraries, etc.
@jen20 @randompunter "CQRS/ES is an idea, not a framework" helps pedagogically, but results in trouble in production just as observed
@jen20 @randompunter I'll still build core w/other tools to reduce risk. Clever math: yes. Custom persistence: no:. HDF5, e.g. in seismic
This is exactly right. Without commercial or widely-adopted OSS tooling, it's too big a "gift" to a client. 
@randompunter But I agree, ES is a bad choice for teams that don't have huge ability to invest in infra over years.
@randompunter few ES "frameworks" are widely used or heavily invested in. if there were an Oracle in the space, it'd be a diff story.

@mjpt777 @viktorklang even if impl is same, distinction is useful for programmers to have in mind. TradeRequested != ExecuteTrade.
@mjpt777 @viktorklang no. In practice "command+ack/fail" is so common it gets optimized (store state in network stack). But not dogma.

@HBJMartin So few moving parts... But the ones that still move are mighty important.
Memory use matters more to the modern server programmer than ever. Can’t wait for them to add Slice&lt;T&gt; to #dotnet 
Memory use matters more to the modern server programmer than ever. Can’t wait for them to add Slice&lt;T&gt; to #dotnet 
Current status: too many Brians.
A more complex #cloud secrets scenario using @ConjurInc for deploying #dotnet apps with @OctopusDeploy on #AWS. 
Large companies limit the number of vendors they use to simplify procurement. But enables existing vendors to effectively charge rent.
graphs are all around us 
@RobAshton: This is the best @stack72 talk I've ever been to, although he didn't turn up and @jen20 is the one giving it. #buildstufflt
@palladiumcs: We use lots of tools here, but when we use #dotnet it’s nice to know now we can deploy to Linux reliably. Nice work!

@JoeIngeno: #Node v5.0.0 (Stable) Released - Not a LTS (Long Term Support) Plan Release  #nodejs
Modern programming languages: write once, run everywhere. So long as everywhere is OS X for a dev box, and Linux for production, natch.
Increasing bandwidth &amp; persistent RAM will change the data center. In short, more cloud.  
Interesting notion. For big customers, don't know why they couldn't. But would be at a real premium cost.  
@wonderella: My costume is only half finished, but I'm going as a software release so I'm ready to go.

@swannodette @bodil @strangeloop_stl most important teacher I had @RiceUniversity
@MrAlanCooper: Cost reduction was the most important management function in 20th Cent. In 21st Cent it is FOCUS. What are we doing? Keep…
@rickasaurus: It's amazing how well git merge works, it's hard to believe it actually.
Now that's a low level interface. #OpenCL
There's usually another factor of 2 in there if you look hard.
@NYCParks: The final section of @highlinenyc opens on Sunday. Who wants to explore? (Photo: Timothy Schenck) 
Life is complicated, especially when you try to simplify. (hat tip @kijanawoodard)
@intel ispc is cool
@BBCNews calls it NO. #indyref
@ShriramKMurthi: Live update page on BBC mentions places like "Benbecula" and "Stornoway", which I don't believe have been in the news s…
@kijanawoodard: good feeling: when you do a massive refactor of a class and all the tests still pass
@EvanBianco didn't expect a retweet on that one.
What would an #indyref have netted in 1776 America?
@drewcrawford word
@voyce: The BBC might not be calling it, but the bookies are: £10 wins £100 on Yes, 50p on No. Polls talk, money walks…? #indyref

@panesofglass interesting. But it'd then be a possibly breaking change to be "approved"
@panesofglass @fsharporg What's wrong with FSharp.?
@BBCBreaking: Polls close in Scotland's #indyref - join our coverage at  as counting begins 
What songs do you listen to when you code? For me, @tearsforfears Elemental reminds me of hash tables and bipartite matching @RiceUniversity
@mfeathers "We looked at Java, the other obvious choice of the Serious, but ultimately decided on Microsoft tech with C#." Whaa?
Using #clojure client-side technologies - including a database - for web apps. Be sure to keep the database small. 
@lighttable  and @JuliaLanguage ... great prototyping environment that produces fast code when you're done.
@nixcraft: Awesome article about Unix shell pipelines  #unix #linux #bash #ksh #osx #bsd 
@aphyr just learned about this this week. Amazing!
Don't reimplement security rules in your system if users' business processes already guard against their violation.
@jbasilio: @mfeathers C hashtag for the win!
@mfeathers: So now it's hip to be sharp? 
@joe_jag: I was in favour of space exploration until I realised what it'd mean for date time libraries
I remember a 10MB hard drive holding EVERYTHING YOU COULD IMAGINE on it. I just emailed a 12MB #PowerPoint presentation.
@rickasaurus: Dear @seamless, I'd really like to be able to mark food as disliked so I don't accidentally order it again, it's ok if you…
@ID_AA_Carmack: In the age of cloud computing and acceptable node failures, I wonder if wafer scale integration could be ready for anoth…
@kendall for?
The one where #mono uses @llvmorg  and outperforms @DotNet. 
@garychou I live a few blocks from there now. Would love to get together sometime.
@sforkmann But I suspect there's still heavy lifting to do in the F# compiler to simplify code like this. codegen should improve w/native?
@sforkmann BTW this benchmark was given to the #mono and RyuJIT teams as well. (#mono faster than CLR, RyuJIT slower, both surprising)
