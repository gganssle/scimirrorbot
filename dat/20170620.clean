Inverting linear systems is so much cooler than sleeping in on a #SundayMorning
@geo_leeman: Yeah man. I'm operating in your domain today. Hardware is righteous.

#Computer #visualizations are pretty, but there's no substitute for a back-of-the-napkin #brainstorm 
Do you guys see the #world laid out in front of you as a vast #sea of #inverse problems?
I had a great time learning about #VirtualReality with the @htcvive yesterday! It'll be a paradigm shift in data viz 
I assert in its one dimensional limit, with a convolutional modeler, full waveform inversion's equivalent to impedance inversion. Rebuttals?

@leouieda The other direction. For viz I let PyCall (Julia package) handle Python requests. Use PyPlot in IJulia for hassle free usability
@leouieda You got it. We write all of our commercial backend stuff in Julia or C variants. Lots of visualization whathaveyous in Python.
@leouieda @JuliaLanguage Do you like the power of Python? Julia's way faster. Not that it matters for a tutorial, but you get the point.
Some inverse problems are hard. Like NP-hard. Srsly. Look at my new experiment to simplify full waveform inversion:
