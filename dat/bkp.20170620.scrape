@feziegler @porestar cc: @kwinkunks
@feziegler @porestar Indeed. So what if the input is white noise, and the output resembles proprietary data?
@porestar @feziegler not probable, but statistically possible. It's just a thought experiment.
@feziegler @porestar here's the other extrema: the output is visually identical to data owned by a co. diff than the input data. Who owns?
@porestar interesting thought. Here's the extrema case: the output is visually identical to some proprietary dataset. Who owns the output?
