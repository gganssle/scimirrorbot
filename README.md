# scimirrorbot

This repo is the guts for the SciMirrorBot on Twitter.

Here's a basic Twitter Bot [reference](https://hackernoon.com/create-a-simple-twitter-bot-with-node-js-5b14eb006c08).

And [here's](https://www.npmjs.com/package/twit) the Twit (npm Twitter API package) documentation.

And and [here's](https://github.com/karpathy/char-rnn) Karpathy's char-rnn which is used to learn users' interests.

And and and [here's](https://dev.twitter.com/docs) the Twitter developer documentation. I think this project'll exclusively utlize the REST API functions.
